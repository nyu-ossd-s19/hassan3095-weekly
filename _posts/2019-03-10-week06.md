## Week 06

would you want to be involved in a project like that?)

### HFOSS Reflection
Coming from a third-World country like Pakistan, I can only appreciate and aspire to be a part of these projects. From the research that I conducted to pick a project to contribute to, many of the big HFOSS projects seemed difficult to get in for two reasons; one being the volume of activity and secondly the complexity of the project. I am not sure how others will deal with prestige when contributing to HFOSS projects but I for sure will be happy about the fact that I was able to contribute.
