## Week 05

### License (Yarn):
Yarn uses BSD 2-Clause license which allows almost unlimited freedom with the software so long as you include the BSD copyright notice in it. One can redistribute, modify and even use it for commercial purposes. One cannot hold Yarn liable for anything and one should always include copyright and license on the software. 

### Installing Development Environment for Yarn:
The development environment was very easy to set up. The process included forking the Yarn's github repository, then installing a couple of dependencies/packkages. Then a simple node command 'yarn build' was required to run which resulted in a successful build.

### Christo's Presentation:
It was a learning experience to understand more about Open Source from a person who is actively a part of this movement since so many years. I didn't know about many of the student run projects that Christos mentioned, so it was good to know more about them. As I have learned more about Open-Source, I wish I had known about Open-Source movement very early in my academic journey because it would've have helped me greatly in building my skillset.
