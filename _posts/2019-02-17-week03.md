### **Browser Extension:**

I ran into some weird browser extention problems around initiating communication between context scripts and the background file. I spent some time attempting to fix the issue, but unfortunately wasn't successful. I seeked help of my teammates, who were responsive, but busy. The communication was done through a Facebook Messenger and we didn't meet in person. There are still things that need to be finished.
